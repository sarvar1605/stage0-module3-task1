## Tasks:
###### 1) Fill the gaps.
Fill in the gaps to make an application write data to console: fill the gaps to print "Fixed" to console with a new line.
Use code snippet provided here (each word should begin with a new line):

    public class FillGapsApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
                 System.out.println("Fixed");
        }
    }


##### 2) Print words.
Make console output like: "java" + \n "is" + \n +"smth". Create java program that will write to console:
java
is
smth

For that use the following code snippet (each word should begin with a new line):

    public class PrintWordsApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            //write your code here
            System.out.println("java\nis\nsmth");
        }
    }

#### 3) Print sentence.
Create main method and make console output: "This is my first Java program". Create java program that will write to
console:
This is my first Java program

For that use the following code snippet (each word should begin with a new line):

    public class PrintSentenceApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("This \n is \n my \n first \n Java \n program");
        }
    }


#### 4) Broken app.
Given piece of code (not compiling one), fill everything that is missing for the program and compile and build it.
Do that inside of a code snippet here (each word should begin with a new line):

    public class BrokenApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("fixMe);
        }
    }

#### 5) Update class.
Update this class to make an output: "I'm updated" + "\n" + "can be compiled. And can write to console"

The code to be updated is inside of a code snippet (each word should begin with a new line):


    public class UpdatedApp {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("I \n am \n updated");
        }
    }
