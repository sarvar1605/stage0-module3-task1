## Tasks:
###### 1) Fill the gaps.
Fill in the gaps to make an application write data to console: fill the gaps to print "Fixed" to console with a new line. Use code snippet provided here (each word should begin with a new line):

public class FillGapsApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
              .           ("Fixed");
    }
}
#### 2) Print words.
Make console output like: "java" + \n "is" + \n +"smth". Create java program that will write to console: java is smth

For that use the following code snippet (each word should begin with a new line):

public class PrintWordsApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //write your code here
    }
}
#### 3) Print sentence.
Create main method and make console output: "This is my first Java program". Create java program that will write to console: This is my first Java program

For that use the following code snippet (each word should begin with a new line):

public class PrintSentenceApp {
}
#### 4) Broken app.
Given piece of code (not compiling one), fill everything that is missing for the program and compile and build it. Do that inside of a code snippet here (each word should begin with a new line):

public class BrokenApp {
    public main(String args) {
        System.out,println("fixMe)
    }
}
#### 5) Update class.
Update this class to make an output: "I'm updated" + "\n" + "can be compiled. And can write to console"

The code to be updated is inside of a code snippet (each word should begin with a new line):

public class UpdatedApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("fixMe");
    }
}
